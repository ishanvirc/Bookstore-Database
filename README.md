# Bookstore Database
 This project involves the creation and management of a relational database for a fictional bookstore. It is designed to showcase proficiency in SQL, database schema design, and data manipulation. The project is structured around MySQL, and it includes the creation of various interconnected tables representing different aspects of a typical bookstore, such as books, authors, categories, customers, and orders.

### Features
- Database Schema Design: Carefully structured relational database schema including tables for authors, categories, books, customers, and orders.
- Data Integrity: Implementation of primary and foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity and relational links between tables.
- Sample Data Insertion: Insertion of sample data into each table to simulate a realistic bookstore environment.
- Query Execution: Execution of various SQL queries to demonstrate data retrieval, manipulation, and reporting capabilities.
### Tables Overview
- Authors: Contains details about authors, including a unique ID, name, and a brief biography.
- Categories: Categorizes books into different genres or types, each with a unique ID and category name.
- Books: Holds information about the books available in the bookstore, including title, author, category, price, and stock quantity.
- Customers: Stores customer information, such as customer ID, name, email, and address.
- Orders: Records details of customer orders, linking customers to the books they've purchased along with order dates and quantities.
### Sample Queries
- Retrieve all books in a specific category.
- Calculate the total number of books sold by each author.
- Update stock quantities after book orders.
- Identify frequent customers based on order history.
- Determine the most popular book category.
### Technologies Used
- MySQL: For database creation, schema design, and query execution.
- SQL: Structured Query Language used for database manipulation and querying.
### How to Use
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Use the provided SQL scripts to create the database and tables in MySQL.
- Insert the sample data into the respective tables.
- Execute the example queries or create your own to explore the database functionalities.
### Future Scope
- Integration with a front-end interface for easier interaction with the database.
- Expansion of the database schema to include more detailed information and additional entities like employees, suppliers, and inventory management.
- Implementation of advanced features like transaction handling, stored procedures, and triggers.
